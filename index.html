      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>After earning an MA in English lit, I spent 6 years applying my writing and design skills to marketing. After years of toying with the idea of coding, I decided to quit my job as a product marketing manager and see if programming was right for me. Now, during the week, you can find me learning to program at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/" target="blank">Epicodus</a>.</p>

      <p>On weekends, you can find me sipping cider in the backyard, painting, reading The Minimalists blog, or YouTubing things like "How to install a tile floor." And, you know, doing all those life things like vacuuming the rugs, reconciling the budget, and filling the yard debris bin.</p>

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Podcasts // Planet Money, Embedded, Freakonomics, The Minimalists, Invisibilia, Reply All</li>
