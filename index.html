      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="well">After earning an MA in English lit, I spent 6 years applying my writing and design skills to marketing. After years of toying with the idea of coding, I decided to quit my job as a product marketing manager and see if programming was right for me. Now, during the week, you can find me learning to program at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/" target="blank">Epicodus</a>. On weekends, you can find me sipping cider in the backyard, painting, reading The Minimalists blog, or YouTubing things like "How to install a tile floor." And, you know, doing all those life things like vacuuming the rugs, reconciling the budget, and filling the yard debris bin.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <h3>Why programming?</h3>
      <p>My dad worked for HP for his entire career as a software engineering helping design printers. When I was younger, he used to say I had a great engineering mind based on how I approached projects and found creative solutions. My freshman year of college, I was torn between engineering and English, and ended up pursuing English, which led to a career in marketing. But marketing has never felt like a natural fit for my skills, and I've always wondered if programming could be right for me. I spent enough years wondering, and now I'm doing something about it.</p>
